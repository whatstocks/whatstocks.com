            can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the App is not
            available to persons under age 18. By accessing and using the App, you accept, without qualification, these
            Terms of Use. If you do not approve and accept these Terms of Use without qualification, you should delete
            the App immediately and are expressly prohibited from using the App and must discontinue use
            immediately.</p>
        <h3>PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE LIMITATION</h3>
        <p>The App is for your personal and non-commercial use. The Firm grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable
            and limited personal license to access and use the App, conditioned on your continued compliance with these
            Terms of Use. You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license,
            create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information, products or services obtained from the App
            or Website. You may not allow others to use your user name or password to access or use any part of the App.
            If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should contact the Firm immediately for a new
            password. If you provide your password to any third party, you will be solely responsible for any actions
            taken by such third party using your password. All information on the non-public (i.e., password-restricted)
            areas of the App is confidential and private and you may not disclose or distribute such information to any
            other person for any purpose and is made available solely for your personal use in connection with your
            investment activities.</p>
        <p>You are prohibited from using the App to advertise or perform any commercial solicitation. You also are
            prohibited from using any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the App or Website for
            any purpose without the prior written permission of the Firm. You may not take any action that imposes, or
            may impose, in our sole discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure,
            interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the App or any activities conducted on the App,
            or bypass any measures that we may use to prevent or restrict access to the App. Any rights not expressly
            granted herein are reserved.</p>
        <h3>NO SECURITIES OFFERING OR TAILORED INVESTMENT ADVICE</h3>
        <p>The information on the App and Website is intended to enable clients to understand the nature of the Firm's
            services. It is not intended as and does not constitute tailored investment advice or legal or tax advice or
            an offer to sell any securities to any person or a solicitation of any person of any offer to purchase any
            securities. The information in the App or Website should not be construed as the Firm's endorsement,
            recommendation or sponsorship of any company or security. There are inherent risks in relying on, using or
            retrieving any information found on the Website or App, and the Firm urges you to make sure that you
            understand these risks before relying on, using or retrieving any information on the Website or App. You

            of professionals, as appropriate, to evaluate any opinion, advice, product, service or other
            information.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that any of your requests for information are unsolicited and any information shall neither
            constitute nor be construed as tailored investment advice from the Firm to you or to form an investment
            advisory relationship, or any other client relationship between you and the Firm or any of its affiliates or
            employees whereby the Firm or its affiliates are providing tailored investment advice to you. The Firm
            strongly recommends that you seek outside advice from a qualified securities professional. The Firm does not
            guarantee the suitability or potential value of any particular investment or information source. The Firm
            may invest or otherwise hold an interest in companies or securities that may be discussed on the Website and

            representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy,
            reliability, suitability or availability with respect to the website, app or the information, products,
            services, or related graphics contained on the website for any purpose. Any reliance you place on such
            information is therefore strictly at your own risk. Security prices and their historical prices shown may
            not be current or accurate.</p>
        <p>In no event will we be liable for any loss or damage including without limitation, indirect or consequential
            loss or damage, or any loss or damage whatsoever arising from loss of data or profits arising out of, or in
            connection with, the use of this Website and App.</p>
        <p>Every effort is made to keep the App up and running smoothly. However, the Firm takes no responsibility for,

            control.</p>

            such information on the terms specified herein, App users agree to use the Confidential Information only for
            the purpose of evaluating potential investment with the Firm and will not reproduce, commercially exploit,

        <h3>SOCIAL MEDIA</h3>
        <p>As part of the functionality of the App, you may link your account with online accounts you have with
            third-party service providers (each such account, a “Third-Party Account”) by either: (1) providing your
            Third-Party Account login information through the App; or (2) allowing user to post screen shots to a
            Third-Party site or app</p>
        <p>Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party
            Account. You represent and warrant that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login
            information to us and/or grant us access to your Third-Party Account, without breach by you of any of the
            terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account, and without obligating us
            to pay any fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by the third-party service provider of
            the Third-Party Account. By granting us access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that (1) we may
            access, make available, and store (if applicable) any content that you have provided to and stored in your
            Third-Party Account (the “Social Network Content”) so that it is available on and through the App via your
            account, including without limitation any friend lists and (2) we may submit to and receive from your
            Third-Party Account additional information to the extent you are notified when you link your account with
            the Third-Party Account. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy
            settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post
            to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your account on the App. Please note that if a
            Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or our access to such Third-Party Account is
            terminated by the third-party service provider, then Social Network Content may no longer be available on
            and through the App. You will have the ability to disable the connection between your account on the App and
            your Third-Party Accounts at any time. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE
            PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH
            THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. We make no effort to review any Social Network Content for any purpose,
            including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality, or non-infringement, and we are not responsible for
            any Social Network Content. You acknowledge and agree that we may access your email address book associated
            with a Third-Party Account and your contacts list stored on your mobile device or tablet computer solely for
            purposes of identifying and informing you of those contacts who have also registered to use the App. You can
            deactivate the connection between the App and your Third-Party Account by contacting us using the contact
            information below or through your account settings (if applicable). We will attempt to delete any
            information stored on our servers that was obtained through such Third-Party Account, except the username
            and profile picture that become associated with your account.</p>
        <h3>SUBMISSIONS</h3>
